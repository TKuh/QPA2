QPA2: Quivers and path algebras, version 2

This repository contains (what is going to be) version 2 of the GAP
package QPA.  For information about QPA version 1, see
http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/

QPA version 2 is intended to have roughly the same functionality as
QPA version 1, but with the basic functionality reimplemented in a
cleaner way.  So far, only a small part of the functionality from
version 1 has been implemented in version 2.

To use QPA2, you need the following non-standard packages:

 * AutoDoc, available at https://github.com/homalg-project/AutoDoc
 * CAP, available at https://github.com/sebasguts/CAP_project
 * ToolsForHomalg, available at https://github.com/homalg-project/ToolsForHomalg

The documentation for QPA2 is written as AutoDoc comments inside the
source code files.  To build the documentation, run `gap makedoc.g` in
the root directory of the package.  This produces documentation in
HTML and PDF form in the directory doc.  The HTML version is also
available at http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oysteini/qpa2/doc/chap0.html

If you encounter any problems or have questions regarding QPA2, you
can either:

 * report an issue at https://github.com/oysteins/QPA2/issues/new, or
 * contact oysteini@math.ntnu.no.
