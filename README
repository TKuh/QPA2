QPA2: Quivers and path algebras, version 2

This repository contains (what is going to be) version 2 of the GAP
package QPA.  For information about QPA version 1, see
http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oyvinso/QPA/

QPA version 2 is intended to have roughly the same functionality as
QPA version 1, but with the basic functionality reimplemented in a
cleaner way.  So far, only a small part of the functionality from
version 1 has been implemented in version 2.

To use QPA2, you need the following non-standard packages:

 * ComplexesForCAP, available at https://github.com/kamalsaleh/ComplexesForCAP
 * InfiniteLists (dependency of ComplexesForCAP),
   available at https://github.com/oysteins/InfiniteLists

Additionally, the package ComplexesForCAP depends on the package CAP
and other packages from the CAP project.  These packages are
distributed with CAP, but ComplexesForCAP may depend on newer versions
than those that are distributed with GAP.  In that case, you need to
get these packages from the source at

    https://github.com/sebasguts/CAP_project

The documentation for QPA2 is written as AutoDoc comments inside the
source code files.  To build the documentation, run `gap makedoc.g` in
the root directory of the package.  This produces documentation in
HTML and PDF form in the directory doc.  The HTML version is also
available at http://www.math.ntnu.no/~oysteini/qpa2/doc/chap0.html

If you encounter any problems or have questions regarding QPA2, you
can either:

 * report an issue at https://github.com/oysteins/QPA2/issues/new, or
 * contact oysteini@math.ntnu.no.
